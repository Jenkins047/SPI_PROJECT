# SPI_PROJECT
It was a project for our digital systems class. Each student created their own exe_unit and later in the course we were grouped in 3-4 people teams. In those teams each member had to add SPI interface to their exe_unit, which had to communicate with provided MASTER device, and provide file with tests.
